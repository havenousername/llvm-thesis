\chapter{Developer documentation}


This chapter will explain the basics of the LLVM Clang compiler, its structure, and the usage of its components inside clang-tidy. It will also explain the process of creating a new checker for the clang-tidy, and the usage of the clang-query tool for debugging. One more important aspect will be to define the solutions which are possible to create under Clang AST, testing and benchmarking of these solutions. In the end, we will have a proper conclusion of the custom checkers created for this thesis. The developer has to have solid C++ knowledge, it is also recommended to be familiar with the compilation process, and to have some user experience with Linux and its environment.
