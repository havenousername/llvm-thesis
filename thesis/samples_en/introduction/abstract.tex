\section{Abstract}

Throughout the whole history of \textbf{Computer Science}, the developers and maintainers of the projects were struggling to solve one particular issue of errors and security flaws in the code base. Several solutions were proposed, one of those being Static Analysis Tools. While there are other ways of error detection, like Dynamic Analysis (done in run time), Static Analysis has the utmost importance in error propagation  related to higher cost in the development process; due to its relatively early stage execution. 

In the following chapters LLVM (modular compiler) \textbf{clang-tidy} tool will be extended and analyzed though independent approaches in creating a linter checker, with performance and quality testing. The result should be a competitive study of LLVM framework static analysis possibilities and the usage of it by both the developers and users for a better C/C++ code experience.
