In this chapter, clang-tidy and clang compiler will be viewed from the user's point of view. Clang-Tidy is part of the clang-extra-tools toolset that can be found in the LLVM repository \cite{clang-tidy-source}. This thesis shows the implementation of 
\lstinline{clang-tidy/cert/AssignmentInSelectionCheck} checker which covers EXP45-C rules.
