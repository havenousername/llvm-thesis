I would like to thank the people, who were the most helpful throughout the whole thesis preparation, with whom I could grow as a person and student, and without whom I can not see myself being an undergraduate student. 

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Zoltán Gera, for his suggestion of the thesis topic, for helping to understand the framework I used for this thesis, and for guiding me through each step of the work, with the suggestions and critique. Prof. Zoltán has ready to guide me every week if I had any complications and explained how to use LLVM documentation. Overall, it was a great pleasure to be under his supervision, and work in the team with others implementors of the clang-tidy checks.   

I also would like to give big gratitude to my compilers professor Horpacsi Daniel, who gave me great insights about how the compilers work, parsing techniques in particular. With his help, I could understand such concepts as LL, and LR parsing and its limitations. Plus, Prof. Horpacsi Daniel also gave me consultations when I was stuck with my implementation, and provided some insights about how I can extend my work.  

I am also grateful for the other professors of ELTE who were not mentioned above, all of them made great work in improving my skills for becoming a better developer and Computer Science student.
